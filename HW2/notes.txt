C-h k           describe-key
M-SPC           just-one-space

C-h k runs the command describe-key (found in global-map), which is an
interactive compiled Lisp function in `help.el'.

M-SPC runs the command just-one-space (found in global-map), which is
an interactive compiled Lisp function in `simple.el'.



Since C-h k runs the command describe-key, hitting “C-h k” followed by some key such as 
“C-h k” or “M-SPC” will also bring you to the definition of what the key you typed means.
This relates to C-h b because it shows the list of keybindings from which you can select a key and see what it does

        (message "Line %d of %d" (1+ (count-lines 1 (point))) (line-number-at-p\
os (point-max)))))))


HW)

since /dev/null is an empty file and the randline.py script reads from the file and 
places the contents into an index, there is an error saying the list index is out of range.
This is because randline.py expects the file to have contents, but the input file is empty.


Python3 gave the error message of the randline.py file not existing


When using python2 was used for shuf.py, the following error exists:
python2: can't open file 'shuf.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory
